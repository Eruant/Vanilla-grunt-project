# Playground

A basic set-up using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/), AMD modules ([Almond](https://github.com/jrburke/almond)) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/)

## Getting started

This pluggin requires you to install [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/). It's a good idea to take a look at the [Getting Started](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started) guide. It does a good job explaining what you need to do to get up to speed.

To use the [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) stylesheets you will also need to download [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/) and install [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/download.html).
